# TS2 UI Viewer

Prototypical UI viewer that attempts to parse and load UIs from TS2.

## INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
* Get Python (3.12 is recommended)
* Install Pygame and Tkinter
* Extract TS2 UI assets via SimPE (these are typically found in UI.package in your TS2 install)
* Move all TGA/PNG files to "assets", and move all TXT/XML files to "guis"

Hopefully it'll work.
